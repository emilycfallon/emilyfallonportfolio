# Emily Fallon's Portfolio
(first Codecademy portfolio project)
This is a portfolio website to display brief information about me, past projects, contact information and a contact form.
It uses HTML, CSS & Javascript.
An HTML form is set up to send the information inputted to the form straight to my email.
Javascript makes the project images able to zoom in and out on click.
When clicked, the images sit on a modal (styled in css) overlaying the webpage.
